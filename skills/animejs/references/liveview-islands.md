# Anime.js on a LiveView island

How Anime.js runs inside a Phoenix LiveView hook in Regent's Ash apps. Everything marked
**(lab)** was reproduced in a browser against phoenix_live_view 1.2.11 and animejs 4.5.0.

## Ownership

- The server owns state and markup. An Ash action decides the outcome; the LiveView
  renders it; the hook only moves pixels. An animation never decides, delays or stands
  in for a result.
- Celebrate a result only after the action returns. In `handle_event`, call the code
  interface or `AshPhoenix.Form.submit/2`; on `{:ok, _}` `push_event/3` the moment to the
  island; on `{:error, form}` assign the returned form (keep it, per ash-frontend).
- On-chain buttons are never gated by motion. Never await an animation before calling
  the wallet, never disable a button or set `pointer-events: none` while motion runs,
  and never skip or merge a second press because an animation is still playing.
  Feedback motion runs alongside the wallet call.
- `regent_ui` components ship no hooks. The product writes the hook and decides when it
  loads, how it handles reduced motion and how it tears down (`design-system/CONSUMERS.md`).
- The hook reads only what the server rendered for this viewer. Never put data in
  `data-*` that the viewer is not allowed to see just because the animation wants it.

## Where the code lives

| App | Hooks | Language | animejs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| regents, keyfleet, the template | `platform/assets/js/hooks/*.ts`, named export, listed in `app.ts` `hooks` | TS, strict, `skipLibCheck` | pinned `4.5.0` in `platform/package.json` |
| autolaunch | `platform/assets/js/hooks/*.ts` | TS | not installed |
| patchbay | `platform/assets/js/hooks/motion/*.js` | JS; no TS gate | pinned `4.5.0` in `platform/assets/package.json` |
| techtree | `app.js` / `assets/js/hooks/*.js` | JS; no TS gate | not installed |

- Adding the dependency: exact pin `"animejs": "4.5.0"` in the app's `package.json`
  (`platform/` for autolaunch, `platform/assets/` for techtree), install with
  `npm`, commit the lockfile. Adding TypeScript islands to techtree or patchbay changes
  their pipeline; ask first.
- Import named functions from `"animejs"`; the esbuild `--bundle` build tree-shakes them.
  Regents, KeyFleet and the template cap `app.js` at 175 KiB gzip (`vitest.budgets.config.ts`).
- Type the hook's `this` the house way (see `hooks/infinite_scroll.ts`): a local type with
  `el`, the LiveView methods you call, and your own fields. Combine behaviours on one element
  with `composeHooks` from `assets/js/hook_composition.ts`.
- Colocated hooks (`<script :type={Phoenix.LiveView.ColocatedHook} name=".X">`) are plain
  JS inside HEEx. Keep Anime.js islands in `assets/js/hooks/*.ts`.
- The reference is the template's motion kit, below. Build a site's motion from it rather
  than from another site's copy.

## The standard motion kit (template)

Every Regent site moves the same way. The template holds the kit, the standard version of
each kind of movement, and the lab where every version that was tried sits side by side.

| File | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `platform/assets/js/hooks/motion/shared.ts` | Timings, curves, `still(el)`, `byPointer(event)`, `lastInputByPointer()`, `play()` |
| `platform/assets/js/hooks/motion/press.ts` | `squish`, `nope`, `deny` |
| `platform/assets/js/hooks/motion/slides.ts` | `drawer`, `sheet`, `menu`, `backdrop` |
| `platform/assets/js/hooks/motion/reveals.ts` | `ShellViews`, `MotionTabs` / `tabsHook`, `HEADLINES`, `GRIDS` |
| `platform/assets/js/hooks/motion/moments.ts` | `MotionList` / `listHook`, `MotionCount` / `countHook` |
| `platform/assets/js/motion.ts` | `mountMotion(document)`: presses, panels, headline and cards on every page |
| `platform/assets/js/motion_lab.ts` | The lab's other versions; lazy-loaded on `/animations` only |
| `platform/lib/ash_template_web/motion.ex` | `AshTemplateWeb.Motion.standard/1`: the version each part uses |

Pages take part through markup, never through their own motion code:

- Every button, `.rg-button` and `[role=button]` squishes on a pointer press; one marked
  `aria-disabled="true"` shakes instead. A wallet button wraps its text in
  `<span data-press-label>`, so only the label squishes and the button never shrinks
  under a quick second press.
- A button with `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` pointing at `data-panel="drawer"`
  slides the drawer out, with its sibling `data-backdrop` fading in.
- A `<details>` whose panel is `data-panel="menu"` pops open; a `<dialog>` rises as a sheet.
- On a page the server draws once (not live), the `h1` rises word by word, the first 12
  children of each `data-cascade` settle in and each `role="alert"` shakes once.
- Live parts use a hook with `data-variant={AshTemplateWeb.Motion.standard("list")}`
  (`MotionList`, `MotionCount` with `data-count` figures, `MotionTabs`).
- `/animations` is the lab: public once the site opens, linked from nowhere. A site
  changes a standard version by comparing there first, then changing `motion.ex`, the
  kit and every site together.

Start every move that hands its element back to the stylesheet with `play()` from
`shared.ts`, never `animate(..., {onComplete: utils.cleanInlineStyles})`. Anime.js's
clean-up restores the inline style it found when the move began, so a move begun over
another's half-way frame (a double press, a replay, a quick reopen) ends stuck on that
frame (lab: cards left at `translateY(16px); opacity: 0`). `play()` first reverts the
element's last move, so each one starts from rest and ends with no inline style. A
finished move is forgotten, so a later one never puts back its old snapshot over
styles written since. `play()` owns `onComplete`; chain extra work with `.then()`.

## Canonical hook (lab)

```ts
import {animate, createScope, stagger, type Scope} from "animejs"

// Hooks mounted during the page's first connection sit on HTML the reader has
// already seen. Only content that arrives after it gets an entrance.
let joined = false
window.addEventListener("phx:page-loading-stop", () => { joined = true }, {once: true})

type ReceiptRevealHook = {
  el: HTMLElement
  handleEvent(event: string, callback: (payload: {id: string}) => void): void
  scope?: Scope
}

export const ReceiptReveal = {
  mounted(this: ReceiptRevealHook) {
    const scope = createScope({
      root: this.el,
      mediaQueries: {reduced: "(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)"},
    })
    const enter = joined

    this.scope = scope.add(() => {
      const reduced = scope.matches.reduced

      if (enter) {
        animate("[data-reveal]", {
          opacity: {from: 0},
          y: reduced ? 0 : {from: 8},
          delay: reduced ? 0 : stagger(24),
          duration: reduced ? 120 : 210,
          ease: "out(4)",
        })
      }

      scope.add("confirmed", () => {
        animate("[data-receipt-total]", {
          scale: reduced ? 1 : [1, 1.06, 1],
          duration: reduced ? 0 : 280,
          ease: "inOut(2)",
        })
      })
    })

    this.handleEvent("receipt:confirmed", ({id}) => {
      if (id === this.el.id) this.scope?.methods.confirmed()
    })
  },

  destroyed(this: ReceiptRevealHook) {
    this.scope?.revert()
  },
}
```

```heex
<section :if={@receipt} id={"receipt-#{@receipt.id}"} phx-hook="ReceiptReveal">
  <p data-reveal>Receipt</p>
  <p data-reveal>Staked <strong data-receipt-total>{@receipt.total}</strong></p>
</section>
```

```elixir
{:noreply, push_event(socket, "receipt:confirmed", %{id: "receipt-#{receipt.id}"})}
```

Why it is shaped this way:
- One Scope per hook, rooted at `this.el`. Selectors inside it only match inside the island.
- `from` animations end on the element's natural, server-rendered state. When a later patch
  strips the inline style, nothing visible changes (lab). The page is fully readable
  without JavaScript because the server never renders `opacity: 0`.
- The entrance plays only for content that arrives after the page connected: a later
  render, a stream insert or a live navigation. See [When a hook mounts](#when-a-hook-mounts-lab).
- Server moments arrive by `push_event`, and `handleEvent` calls a Scope method. Methods
  run inside the Scope, so what they create is tracked and reverted (lab).
- `push_event` reaches every hook on the page listening for that name, including ones in
  other LiveComponents (lab), so the payload names its target's DOM id.
- Reference the `scope` constant, not the constructor's argument: the types declare that
  argument optional, so `self.add(...)` fails under `strict`.
- `destroyed` reverts everything; LiveView removes `handleEvent` callbacks itself.
- In a site, keep the `joined` flag once in the kit's `shared.ts`, in a module the main
  bundle imports before `liveSocket.connect()`; a lazily loaded module misses the event.

## When a hook mounts (lab)

| What happened | Hook callbacks | Entrance? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First page load | `mounted` for every hook, after the server's HTML has been on screen for a network round trip (lab: HTML ready at 41 ms, hooks at 1644 ms with 800 ms of simulated latency), then the first `phx:page-loading-stop` | No: the reader has already seen it |
| Live navigation (`navigate`, `push_navigate`) | Old hooks `destroyed`, then new hooks `mounted` in the same task as the patch, before the browser paints (LiveView source) | Yes |
| A later render adds the element (`:if`, a new list item, `stream_insert`) | `mounted` for the new element only | Yes |
| `stream(..., reset: true)` | Rows whose DOM id stays keep their hook; only new rows mount, dropped rows are `destroyed` (lab) | Only the new rows |
| Connection drops and returns (network, deploy) | Hooks in the template get `disconnected` then `reconnected`, not a new `mounted`. The view renders again from `mount`, so stream rows that are new to the page mount and missing ones are destroyed (lab) | Only rows new to the page |
| `push_event` from the LiveView or any LiveComponent | Every hook on the page with a `handleEvent` for that name (lab) | Filter by the id in the payload |

## What a LiveView patch does to Anime.js's DOM writes

LiveView patches an element whenever its rendered output changes, including when an unrelated
assign re-renders the surrounding template (lab: a counter change ran `beforeUpdate`/`updated`
on an untouched list). Anything the server did not render is removed at that moment, so bugs
show up intermittently.

| Anime.js writes | On the next patch of that element | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inline `style` (`animate`, `utils.set`, draggable, layout, animatable) | Removed (lab) | End animations on the natural state; or add `phx-mounted={JS.ignore_attributes(["style"])}` to keep it (lab); or animate inside a `phx-update="ignore"` island |
| `data-layout-id` from `createLayout().record()` | Removed; Layout can't match old and new, marks the root as entering and nothing moves (lab) | Render `data-layout-id` from the server on the root and every child (lab) |
| `splitText` spans | Server text replaces them | `split.revert()` in `beforeUpdate`, `splitText()` again in `updated` (lab); or `phx-update="ignore"` when the server never changes the text |
| Elements appended by JS (clones, overlays) | Removed from a patched parent; kept in an ignored container (lab) | Remove them in `beforeUpdate`, or append into an ignored container (the lab's `#motion-lab-fx` layer) |

`phx-update="ignore"` (needs a unique `id`): children are never patched; on the ignored element
itself only `data-*` attributes are updated, and `updated()` still runs (lab). That makes
`data-*` the input channel for a fully JS-owned island:

```heex
<div id="meter" phx-hook="Meter" phx-update="ignore" data-level={@level}>
  <div class="bar"></div>
</div>
```

```ts
updated(this: MeterHook) {
  this.scope?.methods.level(Number(this.el.dataset.level))
}
```

Never put a form inside `phx-update="ignore"`: AshPhoenix error rendering stops working.

## Lifecycle map

| LiveView callback | Anime.js work |
| --- | --- |
| `mounted` | `createScope({root: this.el, mediaQueries})`; read `data-*`; entrance (not on the first page load); register methods; `handleEvent` filtered by id |
| `beforeUpdate(toEl)` | `layout.record()`, `split.revert()`, remove JS-added nodes, snapshot geometry |
| `updated` | `layout.animate()`, `splitText()` again, re-read `data-*` and call Scope methods. Must be harmless when nothing relevant changed |
| `disconnected` / `reconnected` | Pause and resume long timelines or scroll observers if the island has them |
| `destroyed` | `scope.revert()` (plus `layout.revert()` / `split.revert()` if created outside the Scope) |

## Scope rules (library source + lab)

- An object joins a Scope only if it is created while that Scope is active: inside a
  constructor passed to `add`, `addOnce` or `keepTime`, or inside a `scope.methods.*` call.
  Work started later from `setTimeout`, a promise or a DOM listener set up in the
  constructor is not tracked; after `revert()` its inline styles stay behind (lab). Send
  that work through a Scope method, or wrap it in `scope.execute(() => ...)`.
- Each Scope method call adds its objects to the Scope, and nothing removes them until
  `refresh()` or `revert()` (lab: 1, 2, 3...). For a stream of server updates (a price tick,
  a progress value), create one `createAnimatable` in the constructor and call its setters.
- A media query change runs `refresh()`: everything reverts and the constructors run again.
  Wrap continuous timelines in `scope.keepTime(() => ...)` so they keep their place.
- Listeners you add yourself go in the constructor, and the constructor returns a cleanup
  function that removes them.

## Layout on server-driven lists (lab)

```heex
<ul id="queue" phx-hook="QueueLayout" data-layout-id="queue">
  <li :for={item <- @items} id={"queue-#{item.id}"} data-layout-id={"queue-#{item.id}"}>...</li>
</ul>
```

```ts
mounted(this: QueueHook) { this.layout = createLayout(this.el, {duration: 280, ease: "inOut(2)"}) },
beforeUpdate(this: QueueHook) { this.layout?.record() },
updated(this: QueueHook) { this.layout?.animate() },
destroyed(this: QueueHook) { this.layout?.revert() },
```

Reorders glide, inserted items fade in (`enterFrom`), and neighbours of a removed item slide
over. The removed item itself disappears immediately: LiveView deletes the node before
`updated`, and Layout only animates leaving elements that become `display: none` or
`visibility: hidden`. For a visible exit, first render the item with the `hidden` attribute
(Layout fades it out and its neighbours close the gap, lab), then drop it in a later render;
or use `phx-remove={JS.transition(...)}` (CSS). The same applies to stream deletes. Use the
stream DOM id as `data-layout-id`.

## Regent motion rules (design-system/STYLE.md)

- Animate `transform` and `opacity` only. Enters ease out, on-screen moves ease in-out.
  Tokens: `--duration-fast|base|slow` = 140/200/280 ms, `--ease-out` =
  `cubicBezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)`, `--ease-in-out` = `cubicBezier(0.77, 0, 0.175, 1)`.
- No idle or decorative loops, no card lift, nothing that follows the pointer (the
  holographic card is the one exception).
- Keyboard-triggered UI does not animate (`byPointer`, `lastInputByPointer`). The one
  exception is `deny`: a refusal shakes however it was asked for, because it is the answer.
- Reduced motion wins: no movement, layout swaps instantly, at most a short opacity fade.
  Ask `still(el)`: the system setting, or a `[data-motion='reduced']` ancestor.
- Content is visible by default. Only hide something after the script has taken over.
- `splitText` keeps an accessible copy of the text by default; leave `accessible` on.
- Nothing writes a style into markup. Clip rising words and digits with the kit's
  `CLIPPED_WORD` / `CLIPPED_CHAR` (the `.split-clip` class), never `splitText`'s `wrap`.
- Error text, costs and transaction outcomes stay visible. Never fade them out.

## Checks

- `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` from `platform/` (budget test included where present).
- Unit-test only the rules around motion, as `assets/test/motion.test.ts` does: a press is
  never stopped, keyboard and reduced motion stay still, a wallet label squishes instead of
  its button, a move begun over another starts from rest. No smoke tests.
- LiveView tests do not run hooks. Check the route in a browser: the animation plays, a
  server patch afterwards leaves the right final state, the island's teardown leaves no
  stray styles, and reduced motion behaves.
- If the browser preview is hidden, the page gets no animation frames and every Anime.js
  animation stalls. Check with headless Playwright from `platform/node_modules/playwright`
  instead: it draws frames, so overlapping presses and end states read true.
- End-state checks: after rapid repeated presses, replays and reopens, every moved element's
  `style` attribute is gone (or back to what the server rendered).
