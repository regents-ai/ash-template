  # A case that sends two callers at one row shares one sandboxed connection
  # between them, so the second caller waits while the first one holds it. The
  # sandbox drops a waiting caller once it has waited longer than twice
  # :queue_target, and it looks for callers to drop once every :queue_interval,
  # which is one second. At the default target of 50ms that abandons a caller
  # after a tenth of a second, and the case then fails on a checkout error
  # rather than on anything it set out to prove. The 1_000ms below lets a
  # caller wait two seconds instead. Across 180 raced callers on a machine held
  # at a load average of 24, the longest any of them held the connection was
  # 70ms, so a tenth of a second leaves almost no room and two seconds leaves
  # plenty.
