# reads. Fly's health check reaches the machine directly over plain HTTP with
# `Host: localhost` (fly.toml), and is answered rather than redirected, so
# `:exclude` sits inside `:force_ssl`, where Plug.SSL reads it. `:force_ssl` is
# read when the endpoint compiles, so it lives here and not in runtime.exs.
