  The standard motion: the version of each kind of movement the real pages
  use, picked in the motion lab at `/animations`. Presses, panels, headlines
  and card lists move the same way on every page from `assets/js/motion.ts`;
  a live part of a page names its version from here in `data-variant`.

  Every Regent site shares these versions. A part the product has no place
  for yet (a note that peels, a stamp that thunks) keeps its version here and
  in the lab, so a page that gains one moves the same way as every other site.
