  What the render knew, signed into the static LiveView token. The token is
  integrity-only and readable by anyone holding the markup, so it carries the
  lineage-stable topic, a digest that names the browser session without being
  able to authenticate as it, rather than the lineage. The route travels with it
  because a connected mount cannot otherwise learn it before `handle_params`,
  which is too late to refuse the mount. The client key travels too, because a
  connected socket cannot see the address header the rendering request carried;
  it is what the page's posts and searches count against
  (`AshTemplateWeb.ClientAddress.client_key/1`). LiveView merges these keys over
  the handshake session, so they can never stand in for the authority the socket
  connected with.

  A LiveComponent's events never reach the page's own event hook, so every
  component that acts calls this from `mount/1`, and its page passes it the
  page's `session_lease` as `lease`. Each event first re-reads that lease, as
  the page does for its own events. A current lease hands `take_account`, the
  component's own function (the one its `update/2` uses too), the account as
  it reads now, and the component rebuilds from it the wallets and actor it
  acts with, so no event acts on a wallet list or actor captured earlier. A
  lapsed lease refuses the event with an empty reply, so a wallet step it was
  asked for is not sent, and tells the page, which withdraws the principal and
  renders signed out. A page with no signed-in session, or one whose component
  acts for a stand-in account, passes a nil lease and the component acts on what
  the page gave it.
