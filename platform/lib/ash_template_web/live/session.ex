  What the render knew, signed into the static LiveView token. The token is
  integrity-only and readable by anyone holding the markup, so it carries the
  lineage-stable topic, a digest that names the browser session without being
  able to authenticate as it, rather than the lineage. The route travels with it
  because a connected mount cannot otherwise learn it before `handle_params`,
  which is too late to refuse the mount. LiveView merges these keys over the
  handshake session, so they can never stand in for the authority the socket
  connected with.
