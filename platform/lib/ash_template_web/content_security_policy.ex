defmodule AshTemplateWeb.ContentSecurityPolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  The content security policies the site's pages are served under.

  `reading/0` is the strict baseline: scripts, styles, images and fonts come
  from this site, requests and the live connection go back to it, no page frames
  another site or is framed itself, and forms submit only here.

  `sign_in/0` is the baseline plus exactly what Privy's wallet sign-in loads,
  taken from Privy's published policy and checked against the bundled Privy
  and WalletConnect code: Privy's API and frame, Cloudflare Turnstile (when bot
  protection is on for the Privy app), WalletConnect's relay, verify frame,
  wallet list, logos, RPC and event reporting, and Coinbase Wallet's relay.
  Privy's sign-in window writes its own style elements, so only this profile
  allows them.

  `showcase/0` is `sign_in/0` for the local showcase, which frames its own
  preview page.

  A site that loads anything else adds each origin to the one directive and the
  one profile that needs it, never as a wildcard.
