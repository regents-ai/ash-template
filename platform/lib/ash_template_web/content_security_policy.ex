defmodule AshTemplateWeb.ContentSecurityPolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  The content security policies the site's pages are served under.

  `reading/0` is the strict baseline: scripts, styles, images and fonts come
  from this site, requests and the live connection go back to it, no page frames
  another site or is framed itself, and forms submit only here.

  `sign_in/0` is the baseline plus exactly what Privy's wallet sign-in loads,
  taken from Privy's published policy and checked against the bundled Privy
  and WalletConnect code: Privy's API, frame and wallet RPC, Cloudflare
  Turnstile (when bot protection is on for the Privy app), WalletConnect's
  relays, verify frame, wallet list, logos, RPC and event reporting, Coinbase
  Wallet's relay, and the `blob:` images Privy's window draws. Privy's sign-in
  window writes its own style elements, so only this profile allows them.

  `showcase/0` is `sign_in/0` for the showcase catalog, which frames its own
  preview page.

  A site that loads anything else adds each origin to the one directive and the
  one profile that needs it. The only wildcard is Privy's own `*.rpc.privy.systems`,
  from its published policy.
