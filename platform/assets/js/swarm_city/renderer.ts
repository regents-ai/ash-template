 * Draws the swarm city with WebGPU through vgpu: a square plate of thin
 * outlined buildings in three downtowns and the low city between them, its
 * streets, the grid over the downtowns, and one disc for each agent, its swarm
 * and their tails behind them, all in one of the city's looks. Loaded only
 * once the city is really going to be shown.
 *
 * Each frame is drawn straight to the page, multisampled so the thin lines
 * stay smooth: the sky and ground first, then the streets, then the sides and
 * roofs, so each building hides what stands behind it (unless the look is
 * glass, which glows or tints), then every line, then the agents over the top.
