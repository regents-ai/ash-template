/**
 * Draws the Keyfleet hero's hex field with WebGPU through vgpu, behind the hero
 * and the Club's map, only when something changed. There is no clock and no
 * idle loop. A pointer or a preview sets a target, the picture eases toward it
 * for a few frames and stops; a wake or a ring fades within the island's
 * easing frames, so the field is always still again shortly after the last
 * touch. Loaded only once a field is really going to be shown.
 *
 * Each value reaches the shader when it changes: the size when the canvas is
 * resized, the colours when the theme changes, the pointer on each frame.
