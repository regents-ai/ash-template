/**
 * Draws the Keyfleet hero's hex field with WebGPU through vgpu, behind the hero
 * and the Club's map, only when something changed. There is no clock and no
 * idle loop. A pointer or a preview sets a target, the picture eases toward it
 * for a few frames and stops; a wake or a ring fades within the island's
 * easing frames, so the field is always still again shortly after the last
 * touch. Loaded only once a field is really going to be shown.

The tiles under the hero's buy words rise out of the field and turn near
black, by as much as the page's own animation says, one frame at a time.
 *
 * Each value reaches the shader when it changes: the size when the canvas is
 * resized, the colours when the theme changes, the pointer on each frame.
