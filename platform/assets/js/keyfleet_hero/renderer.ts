/**
 * Draws the Keyfleet hero's hex field with WebGPU through vgpu, behind the hero
 * and the Club's map, only when something changed. There is no clock and no
 * idle loop. A pointer or a preview sets a target, the picture eases toward it
 * for a few frames and stops. Loaded only once a field is really going to be
 * shown.
 *
 * Each value reaches the shader when it changes: the size when the canvas is
 * resized, the colours when the theme changes, the pointer on each frame.
