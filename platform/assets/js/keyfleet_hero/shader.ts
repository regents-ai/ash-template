/**
 * The Keyfleet hero's hex field, one fullscreen pass over a clear canvas with
 * premultiplied alpha, so the page's own ground shows through and only the
 * lines and the light are the shader's: pointy-top hex tiles behind the hero
 * and the Club's map, a hairline rim on each, lit near the pointer, along the
 * wake a pointer or a finger leaves, in the ring a press sends out, and around
 * the Key while it is previewed. The field fades out toward its edges here
 * rather than in the stylesheet, so a raised tile fades with the tiles around
 * it. The tiles nearest a mouse stand up out of the field, each to its own
 * height, their faces turning from the field's own look toward the deep tone
 * the higher they stand (near black in dark, a darker off-white in light), and
 * sink back into it.
