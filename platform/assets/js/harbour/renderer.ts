 * Draws the agent harbour with WebGPU through vgpu: a blueprint of a sea of

 *
 * Two views of the same harbour: the chart, isometric from above and framed on
 * the islands, and the horizon, looking across the sea from low down with the
 * islands square to the page and the water running out to the sky, for a page
 * background.
 *
 * Each frame the ripples take their steps, the sun draws its shadow map, the
 * scene is drawn into a multisampled target, and a last pass lays it on the page.
 * Every mesh is instanced; the islands and buildings are one instance, the ships
 * and the smoke one each.
