The Phoenix/Ash web application of Ash Template. It serves the public home
page, Privy wallet sign-in, the signed-in Overview (`/app`) and Account
(`/account`) pages, the public pages, health and metrics, and the public HTTP
API.

## Shared dependencies

From a directory that will hold the sibling repositories, acquire the shared
libraries:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/regents-ai/design-system.git
git clone https://github.com/regents-ai/elixir-utils.git
git clone https://github.com/regents-ai/regents.git
```

The expected layout is `<workspace>/<product>/platform`,
`<workspace>/design-system/regent_ui`, `<workspace>/elixir-utils/` and
`<workspace>/regents/identity`. `REGENT_DEPS_ROOT` may point at `<workspace>`
when it is elsewhere; `REGENT_UI_PATH`, `REGENT_PRIVY_PATH` and
`REGENT_IDENTITY_PATH` override one package each. Record the shared
repository commit IDs with check results, and pin isolated worktrees to
immutable revisions rather than updating sibling checkouts during verification.

## Quickstart

Run these from `platform/` after acquiring the shared dependencies. You need
Erlang, Elixir, Node and PostgreSQL at the versions pinned in `.tool-versions`.

```sh
createdb ash_template_dev
cp .env.example .env
touch .env.local
printf '%s\n' 'source_env .env' 'source_env_if_exists .env.local' > .envrc
mix setup
mix ash_template.setup_local_auth
mix phx.server
```

The site is then at `http://localhost:4000`. Sign-in needs real Privy
credentials; [docs/local-privy-auth.md](docs/local-privy-auth.md) says where
they come from. Put real values only in the ignored `.env.local`, never in
`.env.example`, and commit none of the three.

The local server talks to one loopback PostgreSQL database, `ash_template_dev`,
on `127.0.0.1`. The only thing that leaves the machine is sign-in verification
with Privy.

## Configuration

Read at runtime by `config/runtime.exs`. Values come from your ignored
`.env.local` in development and from the deployment's secret store in
production.

| Variable | Required | What it is for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PRIVY_APP_ID` | For sign-in | The Privy application that browser sign-in runs against. |
| `PRIVY_VERIFICATION_KEY` | For sign-in | Privy's PEM-encoded ES256 verification **public** key, not the app secret. |
| `ASH_TEMPLATE_APP_SURFACES` | Yes in production | `on` opens the signed-in pages. Anything else keeps them closed, so a typo closes rather than opens. Boot fails in production if unset. |
| `PHX_HOST` | Yes in production | Public hostname the endpoint builds URLs from. |
| `SECRET_KEY_BASE` | Yes in production | Session signing secret; at least 64 bytes. |
| `PORT` | No | HTTP port. Defaults to `4000`. |
| `SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_RELEASE`, `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` | No | Error reporting. Unset means no reporting. |
| `ASH_TEMPLATE_DEPLOYMENT_ROLE` | Yes in production | `production` or `staging`. There is no default; each role admits only its own database hosts. |
| `DATABASE_POOLED_URL` | Yes in production | Pooled PostgreSQL connection string for an approved host. |
| `DATABASE_DIRECT_URL` | Only when migrating | Direct PostgreSQL connection string used by the migration release command. |
| `ASH_TEMPLATE_DATABASE_TARGET_MODE` | Only when migrating | Must be `production` for the production migration command. |
| `ASH_TEMPLATE_DATABASE_CLUSTER_ID` | For a remote target | Must match the approved cluster. Set neither this nor the name to stay on the loopback database. |
| `ASH_TEMPLATE_DATABASE_CLUSTER_NAME` | For a remote target | Must match the approved cluster name. |
| `ASH_TEMPLATE_RELEASE_COMMAND` | Set by the release | `migrate` switches the boot into migration mode. |

## Public HTTP surface

`contracts/api-contract.openapiv3.yaml` is the source of truth for the API and
is served at `/api-contract.openapiv3.yaml` with `x-regents-contract-major` and
`x-regents-contract-digest` headers. The table is a map, not the contract.

| Route | Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/healthz` | GET | Liveness check; plain text `ok`. |
| `/metrics` | GET | Prometheus metrics. |
| `/api/v1/profile`, `/api/v1/profile/sync` | GET, PATCH, POST | The signed-in person's shared profile, served by the `regent_identity` package with paired Privy proofs. |
| `/auth/csrf`, `/auth/session`, `/auth/privy/session`, `/auth/privy/failure` | GET, POST, DELETE | Browser session start, read and end. |
| `/openapi.json`, `/llms.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/robots.txt` | GET | Discovery documents. |
| `/`, `/docs`, `/about`, `/contact`, `/privacy`, `/terms` | GET | Public pages; `Accept: text/markdown` returns Markdown. |
| `/app`, `/account` | GET | The signed-in shell. |

## Repository layout

```

## Checks

From the monorepo root, `make check-platform` runs this component's gate and
`make check` runs every component's:

```sh
mix precommit
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

These need `MIX_TEST_PARTITION` set, even to an empty value, and
`REGENT_DEPS_ROOT` when the shared dependencies live outside the sibling layout
(see [Shared dependencies](#shared-dependencies)). For example, with the test
database `ash_template_test`:

```sh
MIX_TEST_PARTITION= REGENT_DEPS_ROOT=<workspace> make check
```

The browser suite runs separately with `npm run test:browser`.

`mix precommit` compiles with warnings as errors, checks unused dependency
locks and formatting, runs Credo in strict mode and Sobelow, holds the
compile-connected `xref` graph under its limit, runs the test suite with
warnings as errors, and verifies the Ash codegen and route handoff are current.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-checks the TypeScript assets. |
| `npm test` | Runs the Vitest unit suite. |
| `npm run test:browser` | Builds the assets, then runs the browser suite against a test server. |
| `npm run test:budgets` | Enforces the asset size budgets. |
| `mix test.external` | Runs one Docker build-context test that needs tools outside the hermetic suite. |

The test database name carries whatever `MIX_TEST_PARTITION` holds, just
before its `_test` ending. Give each test run its own value whenever more
than one can happen on a machine: `MIX_TEST_PARTITION=_a1b` gives
`ash_template_a1b_test`. Run `MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.create` once for a new
value; the suite builds the schema itself on its first run.

## Deployment

Deploying runs `/app/bin/migrate` as its release command, so a deploy writes
database migrations. Every deployment names its venue in
`ASH_TEMPLATE_DEPLOYMENT_ROLE`, and each role admits only its own database
hosts. Production boot also fails unless `ASH_TEMPLATE_APP_SURFACES`,
`PHX_HOST` and a 64-byte `SECRET_KEY_BASE` are set.
`/app/bin/pending-migrations` reports what a deployed database and the release
image disagree about, without applying anything.

The image is built from `Dockerfile`; `scripts/build-release-context.sh`
assembles its offline build context. The Fly configuration lives in `fly.toml`
and `fly.staging.toml`.
