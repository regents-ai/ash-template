# Ash Template platform

This is the Phoenix/Ash component of the template monorepo. Run Mix and npm here.
`lib/ash_template/` owns domains; `lib/ash_template_web/` owns routes and live
pages. `contracts/` holds the OpenAPI contract, synced to `priv/static/` with
`mix ash_template.sync_api_contract`. Keep the placeholder names until
`scripts/init.sh` renames them.

Follow the root instructions and the workspace's `regent-workflow`. Use the
assignment's acceptance and applicable focused checks. Browser fixtures belong to
the prepared local database. Shared dependencies (`design-system/regent_ui`,
`elixir-utils/privy`, `elixir-utils/agent_access`, `elixir-utils/credo_ash`,
`regents/identity`) resolve through `REGENT_DEPS_ROOT`.
