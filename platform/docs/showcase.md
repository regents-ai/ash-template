# Local component workshop

Open `/showcase` on a development or test server using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.
The production configuration omits its routes. HTTP requests and connected
page mounts both require a loopback peer and a loopback hostname; forwarded
headers do not grant access. Gallery styles and metadata use the same guard.

## What it shows

The workshop renders the active components installed from `regent_ui` and
`AshTemplateWeb.Components`, plus both layouts, composed in the shared
`Regent.Structure` frames, rows, section bars and panels. The shell preview
includes working navigation and theme behavior but omits sign-in controls.

Palette cards pair each site's light/dark colors with a real
surface/text/primary preview. Four editable colors (background, surface, text
and primary) are stored separately for each site/mode in browser storage; Reset
affects only the selected palette. The Shimmer color picker overrides
`--rg-shimmer-color` for the workshop document and resets on reload.

`Regent.Structure.capability_card/1` is the shared card, not workshop-specific
HTML. Its API, together with every component's attributes and slots, the
installed Ash domain/resource/action metadata and the exported utility APIs, is
listed at `/showcase/catalog`. The catalog never reads resource records.

## Privy working reference

`/showcase/privy` uses the real account control and auth bridge, not the
separate wallet fixture in the main gallery. It includes configuration
instructions, header Sign In/Disconnect, in-page connection controls and the
selected wallet. Controls are disabled with an explanation when configuration is
missing or the server uses a test verifier. No configuration values, tokens or
provider objects are displayed, and the page requests no transaction or extra
signature.

For real testing, use the configured development server and a Privy-allowed
localhost origin with `PRIVY_APP_ID` and `PRIVY_VERIFICATION_KEY` set. Prepare
the local database (`ash_template_dev`), run `mix ash_template.setup_local_auth`,
then `mix assets.build` and `mix phx.server`. Do not use browser-test
configuration as proof of real Privy sign-in.

## Utility effects

- Wallet fixture: a separate local provider demonstrates connect/disconnect,
  overlapping presses, confirmation, rejection and revert. It never enters the
  real wallet store or sends a network request.
- Create/add/reset items and edits use a local Ash sample action with an
  in-memory data layer. Copy writes the displayed result through the browser
  clipboard API. These examples never write product records.
- Privy verification: signs an ephemeral fixture token and calls `RegentPrivy`
  for valid, expired and incorrect-audience outcomes. No fixture token enters an
  authentication endpoint; no key or token is displayed or retained.
- Postgres: a fixed read-only diagnostic accepts only the prepared loopback
  test database naming convention. It refuses other database settings.

## Run in an isolated worktree

Give the worktree its own `MIX_TEST_PARTITION`, a unique `PORT` and, when the
shared repositories are elsewhere, `REGENT_DEPS_ROOT`. Install locked Mix and
npm dependencies, then run `mix assets.build`. A prepared test database can be
created with `MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.create`.

Run the disposable test server with that partition and port:

```sh
env MIX_ENV=test ASH_TEMPLATE_BROWSER_TEST=1 mix run --no-halt -e 'Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox.mode(AshTemplate.Repo, :auto)'
```

That command belongs only in the isolated test context. Use its printed URL and
append `/showcase`.

## Focused verification

```sh
mix test test/ash_template_web/showcase
npm run typecheck
npm test
PORT=<port> npx playwright test --config playwright.showcase.config.ts
```

The dedicated browser configuration avoids the product suite's seeding and
global teardown. Failures retain screenshots and traces in `test-results/`.
