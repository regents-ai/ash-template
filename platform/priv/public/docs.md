# Developer documentation

Ash Template has a small public surface: documentation you can read without an account, a health check, and one account API for the person who signed in.

## Start without an account

Public documentation and the health check need no API key or wallet. Read this page, the [agent guide]({{origin}}/llms.txt) or the [OpenAPI JSON specification]({{origin}}/openapi.json).

```sh
curl --fail '{{origin}}/healthz'
curl --fail -H 'Accept: text/markdown' '{{origin}}/docs'
curl --fail '{{origin}}/openapi.json'
```

The health response is the plain text `ok`. It confirms the web service is responding, not that every outside service is available.

The homepage, this documentation, About, Contact, Privacy and Terms answer `Accept: text/markdown` at their ordinary addresses. Browsers receive HTML by default. Unknown page addresses return 404 rather than an empty document.

## Read and update your profile

`GET /api/v1/profile` returns the profile of the person whose credentials are presented. `PATCH /api/v1/profile` updates its `display_name` or `wallet_address`. `POST /api/v1/profile/sync` creates the profile on first use and refreshes it from your sign-in evidence afterwards.

Every request carries both a Privy access token in `Authorization: Bearer …` and a Privy identity token in `Privy-Id-Token`. These are your own sign-in credentials, not an API key. Keep them private; never paste tokens, private keys or recovery phrases into a chat, report or public issue.

The following command assumes the two token variables were supplied through your own secure credential handling:

```sh
curl --fail-with-body '{{origin}}/api/v1/profile' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${PRIVY_ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Privy-Id-Token: ${PRIVY_IDENTITY_TOKEN}"
```

A successful response contains a `profile` object with the profile id, display name, the linked wallets and the selected wallet. Missing or invalid credentials return 401. A profile that has not been created yet returns 404; call `POST /api/v1/profile/sync` first. An invalid update returns 422. A service that is not configured for sign-in returns 503. Profile responses are never cached.

## Errors

Every JSON error has one shape:

```json
{"error": {"code": "not_found", "message": "Not Found", "hint": "See {{origin}}/docs and {{origin}}/openapi.json for supported requests."}}
```

`code` is stable and meant for programs, `message` says what went wrong and `hint` says what to do next. Profile answers carry the `code` alone, for example `authentication_required`, `profile_not_created` or `invalid_profile_update`. Branch on the status and the `code`, never on the wording of `message`.

An unknown address under `/api` answers JSON 404 whatever the `Accept` header says. An unknown page address answers 404 as HTML, or as Markdown when you ask for `text/markdown`. The [OpenAPI JSON specification]({{origin}}/openapi.json) lists every status each operation can return.

## Rate limits

Each client address has 120 requests per 60 seconds, shared by `/healthz` and `/api/v1`. Every answer says where you stand:

```http
RateLimit-Policy: "default";q=120;w=60
RateLimit: "default";r=119;t=42
```

`q` is the number of requests allowed in a window of `w` seconds, `r` is how many remain and `t` is the number of seconds until the window resets. Past the limit the answer is `429` with the code `too_many_requests` and a `Retry-After` header in seconds; wait that long, then send the request again.

## Versioning and deprecation

- The API version is in the path (`/api/v1`) and in `info.version` of the [OpenAPI JSON specification]({{origin}}/openapi.json). New endpoints, response fields and optional inputs can appear at any time, so ignore fields you do not recognise.
- A breaking change, such as removing or renaming a field, endpoint or error code, changing a type or making an input required, ships in place under the same path. It is listed below on the day it ships and `info.version` moves to a new major number. There is no notice period and no `Deprecation` or `Sunset` header, so check `info.version` before relying on a field.

### Breaking changes

None yet.

## Browser tools

Every page offers a browser's own agent these tools through WebMCP (`document.modelContext`). Each reads one of the public documents as Markdown, needs no sign-in and changes nothing. The [tool manifest]({{origin}}/capabilities) describes them as JSON.

## Contracts

The [OpenAPI JSON specification]({{origin}}/openapi.json) describes the health check and the profile API above, including their authentication requirements. The [YAML contract]({{origin}}/api-contract.openapiv3.yaml) is the full served contract, including the browser session endpoints the site itself uses. The [API catalog]({{origin}}/.well-known/api-catalog) (RFC 9727) points to the OpenAPI specification and this page, and [security.txt]({{origin}}/.well-known/security.txt) names where to report a vulnerability.

Public documentation does not authorize a payment, signature, credential change or other change to your account.
