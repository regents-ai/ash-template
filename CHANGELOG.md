## 2026-09-22 — Template cut from Regents

- Cut this template from the Regents monorepo at commit `0bbd67c`.
- Kept the Phoenix/Ash platform with the public home page, Privy wallet sign-in,
  the signed-in Overview and Account pages, the public pages, health and
  metrics, `/llms.txt`, `/openapi.json` and the served API, the design-system
  styling, a pnpm CLI skeleton, an empty optional contracts workspace and an
  empty plugins folder.
- Renamed the placeholder product to Ash Template (`ash_template`, `AshTemplate`,
  `ash-template`, `ASH_TEMPLATE_`).
- Removed everything specific to Regents: staking, Redeem, Autolaunch,
  Formation, Regents Club, ENS, OpenSea, the blog, Regent Names and claims,
  public profiles, agent sign-in, sprites, the Base RPC reads, the Regents CLI
  commands and the Solidity contracts.

## 2026-09-22 — PostgreSQL 17 pin

- Pinned `postgres 17.7` in `platform/.tool-versions`, the server every environment runs.

## 2026-09-22 — mint 1.10.1

- Moved the mint HTTP client to 1.10.1, which closes the medium-severity
  EEF-CVE-2026-82672 (HTTP/1 response smuggling through an unvalidated
  chunk-size line). Lockfile-only change.

## 2026-09-22 — Template cleanup

- `scripts/init.sh` also renames the camel-case `ashTemplate` and the
  capitalised display name "ASH TEMPLATE" in the terms.
- Removed browser code no page used: the HomeField, HomeHero, InfoDialog and
  ModalDialog hooks, the background manifest and its images, the bundled font
  copies (the design system serves the fonts), the unused brand images and
  screenshots, the compatibility token file and the unused styles.
- Sign-in errors and warnings no longer name Regent. The Account page no longer
  shows a World ID row, and linked identities accept only X, GitHub and
  Farcaster.
- Removed the unused public-profile read and the picosat solver; `simple_sat`
  is the one solver.
- The route handoff files are `priv/handoff/route-catalog.*`, and test names
  carry no ticket tags.
- The CLI runs Vitest 4.1.11 with Vite 7.3.6 and an esbuild floor; CI takes its
  Node version from `platform/.tool-versions`.
- `make check` runs every component's gate; the platform gate adds the
  TypeScript typecheck and unit tests.
